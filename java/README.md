# Java
If you somehow don't have a Java install, start by [installing OpenJDK from Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)

The program has a minimum requirement of Java 11 due to the use of multi-line strings, but it could probably run from Java 8 if that string was replaced with standard concatenation. If you're installing fresh, just grab a JDK17 install.

To run, you'll just need to open this folder in a terminal and run the following

```
javac Runner.java
java Runner
```

## VSCode
I can't speak for the "Extension Pack for Java" extension in the marketplace, but it should provide decent support for the language. 

Similar to Python, I used IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Java application.

## Notes on IDEs

I'd strongly recommend utilizing a Java-specific IDE for dedicated Java development such as IDEA or Eclipse.

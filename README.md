# keno_examples
Contains the same application written in several languages performing a basic simulation to derive Keno odds based on the given payout table for multiple types of games.

Each directory contains the necessary source to run the application in that language. The purpose of this exercise is mostly to explore languages, so each application was written using the initial Python application as a template.

With this in mind, enhancements have been added where possible to better fit the target language, but since this is exploratory the programs will mostly be a 'copy' of the Python application in the target language.

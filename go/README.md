# Go
To start, you'll need to install Go. [You can find a download URL from their website](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Once that's installed, you can run the application by opening a terminal and running the following

```dos
go run keno.go
```

## VSCode
VSCode users may wish to install the Go extension in the marketplace for core language support.

# Python
You'll need a Python install. The code in this application is simple, so you should be able to run it using virtually any 3.x version, but I used 3.11 during development.

[Python installs can be found here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Normally, Python projects utilize a virtual environment. This one actually doesn't need it since it has no dependencies, but you can create and use one by opening a terminal in this folder and running the following

```
python -m venv venv
\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then, to run the program, simply run the following from the terminal

```
python main.py
```

## VSCode 
As usual, there's a good extension on the marketplace for this. Consider installing the Python extension from Microsoft for core language support.

Note that I utilized PyCharm for development here, but there's no reason that VSCode should cause issues.
